👋 Hey everyone! @IMDR21 is here!

A few things about me – I am a web developer with a particular affinity towards front-end development, web designing, and the user experience. I take pride in being a web developer since there are always new things to learn and skills to hone in this field. 
🔍 What I’m working on

        🌱 Learning React and building interactive web applications with RESTful services.
        💻 Also, I am getting into CSS animations to make the interface more interesting and interactive.

🤝 Let’s work together!

I’m keen on lending my hand to open source projects and in particular to the ones that are about:

    - Front end technology
    - User Interface/User Experience
    - Internet-community oriented waved services

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any interesting works in progress.
